# dotfiles

This is a dotfiles repo that does some initial setup magic and customisation for [coder](https://github.com/coder/coder) and [github codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces). However (theoretically) it would work fine with any other linux/macos environment.

## Installation

```sh
# Run the installation script.
./install.sh
```
